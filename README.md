# Digital Image Processing (DIP) Lab

This repository contains MATLAB codes, scripts, and resources for all **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** labs conducted during the course, guided by [**Dr. Tapan Jain**](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-tapan-jain-18731717).  

---

## Lab 1: Fundamentals of Image Processing  

### Topics Covered  
1. [**Reading and Displaying Images**](./image_read_and_show.m)  
   - Learn how to load an image into MATLAB and display it using `imshow()`.  

2. [**Splitting an Image into RGB Channels**](./split_color_channels_GUI)  
   - Extract the Red, Green, and Blue channels from an RGB image and display them separately.  

3. [**RGB to Grayscale Conversion**](./rgb_2_grayscale_algorithms)
   - Apply different algorithms (Average, Weighted Average, Luminosity, and Desaturation) to convert an RGB image to grayscale.  

## Lab 2: Histogram Equalization  
- [**Histogram Equalization**](./hist_eq): Perform contrast enhancement on grayscale images using a GUI and visualize the results with histograms and CDF plots.
